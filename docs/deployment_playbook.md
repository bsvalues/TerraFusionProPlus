# TerraFusionProfessional Deployment Playbook

## Overview

This playbook provides standard operating procedures for deploying, maintaining, and troubleshooting the TerraFusionProfessional platform infrastructure.

## Deployment Workflows

### Standard Release Process

1. **Pre-Deployment Checklist**
   - Code review completed and approved
   - All automated tests passing
   - Security scan completed with no critical issues
   - Database migration scripts verified
   - Release notes prepared

2. **Deployment Schedule**
   - Standard releases: Tuesday and Thursday, 10:00 AM EST
   - Emergency fixes: As needed with approval
   - Blackout periods: End of month (28th-3rd)

3. **Deployment Steps**
   - Tag release in repository
   - Trigger deployment pipeline
   - Monitor canary deployment metrics
   - Approve production deployment
   - Verify deployment success

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify critical business transactions
   - Monitor error rates and performance metrics
   - Check customer-facing functionality

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Rollback Triggers**
   - Error rate increases by 10%
   - P90 latency increases by 100ms
   - Any critical user-facing functionality broken
   - Manual rollback decision by on-call engineer

2. **Rollback Steps**
   - Trigger rollback pipeline
   - Revert to last known good deployment
   - Run database rollback scripts if necessary
   - Verify system stability after rollback
   - Document incident and schedule post-mortem

## Infrastructure Management

### Scaling Procedures

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Monitor CPU utilization (target: 60-80%)
   - Monitor memory utilization (target: 70-85%)
   - Adjust HPA min/max replica count as needed
   - Update cluster autoscaler configuration for node count

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Analyze resource usage patterns
   - Adjust resource requests/limits
   - Test with canary deployment
   - Roll out across all environments

### Resource Management

1. **Resource Quotas**
   - Review namespace quotas monthly
   - Implement resource limits for all workloads
   - Monitor resource utilization with alerts at 80%
   - Optimize resource allocation based on usage patterns

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Regular review of idle resources
   - Scheduled scale-down for non-production environments
   - Spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
   - Right-sizing analysis quarterly

## Maintenance Procedures

### Routine Maintenance

1. **Kubernetes Updates**
   - Minor version updates: Monthly
   - Major version updates: Quarterly
   - Update process:
     - Test in development environment
     - Update staging environment with 1-week observation
     - Schedule production update with 2-week notice

2. **Database Maintenance**
   - Index optimization: Monthly
   - Vacuum analyze: Weekly
   - Performance tuning: Quarterly
   - Version upgrades: Semi-annually

### Certificate Management

1. **TLS Certificate Rotation**
   - Automated renewal through cert-manager
   - Manual verification monthly
   - Emergency rotation procedure documented
   - Certificate inventory maintained in secrets management system

2. **Internal PKI**
   - Service mesh certificate rotation: Monthly
   - Root CA rotation: Annually
   - Intermediate CA rotation: Semi-annually

## Disaster Recovery Procedures

### Database Failure Recovery

1. **Primary Database Failure**
   - Automated failover to replica
   - Verify data consistency
   - Rebuild failed instance
   - Restore to cluster as new replica
   - Conduct failback during maintenance window

2. **Complete Cluster Failure**
   - Restore from latest backup to new cluster
   - Apply transaction logs to minimize data loss
   - Update connection strings in configuration
   - Verify application functionality
   - Rebuild replication setup

### Application Recovery

1. **Single Service Failure**
   - Scale healthy pods
   - Isolate and investigate failed instances
   - Deploy fixes if identified
   - Update runbooks with new failure modes

2. **Complete Environment Failure**
   - Activate secondary region if available
   - Restore services in priority order:
     1. Database services
     2. Authentication services
     3. API core services
     4. Auxiliary services
     5. Frontend applications
   - Verify critical path functionality
   - Communicate status to stakeholders

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Alert Response Procedures

1. **Critical Alerts (P1)**
   - Response time: 15 minutes
