# TerraFusionProfessional Monitoring Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive monitoring strategy for TerraFusionProfessional. The monitoring infrastructure is designed to provide full visibility into the platform's health, performance, and usage patterns.

## Core Monitoring Components

- Deployment status and rollout progress
- Resource utilization vs. requests/limits
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler metrics

### 2. Application Monitoring

#### API Service Metrics
- Request rate (requests per second)
- Error rate (percentage of 4xx/5xx responses)
- Latency (p50, p90, p99 percentiles)
- Request duration by endpoint
- Backend service dependencies health

#### Database Metrics
- Query throughput and latency
- Connection pool utilization
- Transaction rate and duration
- Lock contention and wait times
- Index usage and cache hit ratio

#### Frontend Metrics
- Page load time
- Time to interactive
- Client-side errors
- API call performance
- User interactions (clicks, form submissions)

### 3. Business Metrics

#### User Engagement
- Active users (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Session duration and frequency
- Feature usage statistics
- Conversion funnels
- User retention rates

#### Operational Metrics
- Pipeline execution volume
- Deployment success/failure rates
- Build times and test coverage
- Infrastructure costs by component
- Resource utilization efficiency

## Monitoring Infrastructure

### 1. Metrics Collection Stack

- **Prometheus**: Core metrics collection and storage
  - Service discovery via Kubernetes API
  - Custom exporters for application metrics
  - Long-term storage with Thanos or Cortex

- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing and application instrumentation
  - Context propagation across service boundaries
  - Automatic instrumentation of web frameworks
  - Custom spans for business-critical operations

- **Fluentd/Fluentbit**: Log collection and forwarding
  - Container logs aggregation
  - Application logs with structured formatting
  - Kubernetes events collection

### 2. Storage and Analysis

- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and analysis
  - Retention policies by log importance
  - Index lifecycle management
  - Full-text search capabilities

- **InfluxDB**: Time-series metrics for long-term trends
  - Downsampling for historical data
  - Continuous queries for aggregations
  - Retention policies by metric importance

- **Jaeger**: Distributed trace storage
  - Sampling strategies by endpoint importance
  - Trace comparison and analysis
  - Service dependency mapping

### 3. Visualization and Alerting

- **Grafana**: Dashboards for all metrics
  - Role-based dashboard access
  - Template variables for environment selection
  - Annotated events for deployments and incidents

- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and management
  - Grouping and deduplication rules
  - Escalation policies by severity
  - Silencing mechanisms for maintenance

- **PagerDuty**: On-call management and incident response
  - Rotation schedules by service area
  - Escalation policies and timeouts
  - Mobile notifications

## Dashboard Structure

### 1. Executive Dashboards
- Platform health overview
- SLA/SLO compliance status
- Resource utilization and cost trends
- Key business metrics visualization

### 2. Operational Dashboards
- Service health by component
- Deployment and release status
- Error rates and performance bottlenecks
- Capacity planning metrics

### 3. Developer Dashboards
- Service-specific performance metrics
- API usage patterns
- Database query performance
- Error logs and exception tracking

### 4. Security Dashboards
- Authentication/authorization events
- Network policy violations
- Vulnerability scan results
- Compliance status indicators

## Alerting Strategy

### 1. Alert Severity Levels

#### Critical (P1)
- Complete service outage
- Data loss or corruption risk
- Security breach
- SLA violation imminent
- Response time: 15 minutes, 24/7

#### High (P2)
- Partial service degradation
- Performance below threshold
- Resource saturation imminent
- Repeated error patterns
- Response time: 30 minutes, 24/7

#### Medium (P3)
- Anomalous behavior detected
- Non-critical component failure
- Slow performance trends
- Resource utilization warnings
- Response time: 2 hours, business hours

#### Low (P4)
- Optimization opportunities
- Non-customer-impacting issues
- Technical debt indicators
- Response time: Next business day

### 2. Alert Routing

| Severity | Initial Notification | Escalation Path | Communication Channel |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| P1 | Primary on-call | Secondary on-call → Engineering Manager → CTO | Phone + Slack |
| P2 | Primary on-call | Secondary on-call → Team Lead | Slack + Email |
| P3 | Team rotation | Team Lead | Slack + Ticket |
| P4 | Team queue | N/A | Ticket only |

### 3. Alert Tuning Process

- Weekly review of alert frequency and actionability
- Fine-tuning of thresholds based on historical data
- Automation of common remediation steps
- Documentation of resolution steps in runbooks
