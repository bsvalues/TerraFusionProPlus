- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with structured log formats
- **Alerting System**: Multi-channel alerting with escalation policies and on-call rotation
- **Service Level Objectives**: Defined SLOs with automated reporting and compliance tracking

### 5. Security Framework

- **Secret Management**: Zero-trust secrets management with rotation policies
- **Network Security**: Service mesh implementation for zero-trust networking
- **Identity Management**: RBAC and JIT access management for all services
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance checks and reporting
- **Security Scanning**: Continuous security scanning in all environments

### 6. Scalability Model

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: CPU and memory-based autoscaling for services
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaling**: Resource optimization based on historical usage
- **Cluster Autoscaling**: Dynamic node provisioning based on workload demands
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource quota management and idle resource reclamation

## Resource Estimation

| Environment | Total CPU | Total Memory | Monthly Cost Estimate |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Production  | 12 cores  | 24 Gi        | $2,500 - $3,000      |
| Staging     | 6 cores   | 12 Gi        | $1,200 - $1,500      |
| Development | 4 cores   | 8 Gi         | $800 - $1,000        |

## Monitoring Strategy

### Key Metrics
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Application Metrics**: Request rates, error rates, latency
- **Business Metrics**: Transaction volume, user activity, conversion rates

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Critical**: Service outage or severe degradation - immediate notification
- **Warning**: Performance degradation or resource pressure - notification during business hours
- **Info**: Unusual patterns requiring investigation - daily digest

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Backup Strategy
- **Database**: Hourly incremental backups, daily full backups, weekly integrity checks
