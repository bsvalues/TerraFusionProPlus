# TerraFusionProfessional Security & Compliance Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the security and compliance framework for the TerraFusionProfessional platform, establishing standards, controls, and procedures to ensure data protection, regulatory compliance, and security best practices.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Defense-in-Depth Strategy

#### Network Security
- **Edge Protection**: Cloud provider WAF with DDoS protection
- **Ingress Control**: API Gateway with rate limiting and authentication
- **Network Segmentation**: Microservice isolation via network policies
- **Service Mesh**: Mutual TLS for all service-to-service communication
- **Egress Control**: Outbound traffic filtering and monitoring

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Containerized deployments with read-only file systems
- **Image Security**: Base image hardening and vulnerability scanning
- **Host Security**: Minimal host OS with regular patching
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption for all data
- **Secrets Management**: Zero-trust secrets access with rotation

#### Application Security
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for all user access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with least privilege
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation with strict schemas
- **Output Encoding**: Context-specific encoding to prevent injection
- **Session Management**: Secure, time-limited sessions with proper invalidation

### 2. Security Controls

#### Preventive Controls
- Infrastructure as Code security policies
- Pre-commit hooks for sensitive data detection
- Container image scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security-focused code reviews

#### Detective Controls

- Self-healing infrastructure capabilities
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 3. Identity & Access Management

#### Authentication Systems

- Configuration security assessment

#### Remediation
- Vulnerability prioritization framework
- Remediation SLAs by severity
- Compensating control implementation
- Patch management process
- Verification testing procedure

## Data Protection

### 1. Data Classification

#### Classification Levels
- **Public**: Information explicitly approved for public disclosure
- **Internal**: Non-sensitive information for internal use
- **Confidential**: Sensitive information requiring protection
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls
- **Regulated**: Information subject to specific regulatory requirements

#### Data Handling Requirements
| Classification | Access Control | Encryption | Retention | Disposal |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Public | None | Not required | Business need | Standard deletion |
| Internal | Basic authentication | In transit | Business need | Standard deletion |
| Confidential | Role-based access | In transit & at rest | Defined policy | Secure deletion |
| Restricted | Strict need-to-know | End-to-end | Defined policy | Secure deletion with verification |
| Regulated | Compliance-based | End-to-end with key management | Regulatory requirement | Compliance-based process |

### 2. Data Lifecycle Management

#### Collection
- Lawful basis establishment
- Consent management
- Data minimization practices
- Privacy notice requirements
- Collection limitation controls

#### Processing
- Purpose limitation enforcement
- Processing activity recording
- Lawful processing verification
