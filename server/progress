Database migration failures	High	Multiple rehearsals in staging, point-in-time recovery capability
AI service performance issues	Medium	Circuit breakers, fallbacks to traditional processing
Spectrum DB integration delays	High	Develop local cache and fallback mechanisms
Rust learning curve	Medium	Pair programming, training sessions, initial focus on isolated services
Security vulnerabilities	Critical	Regular scanning, periodic penetration testing, security reviews
This comprehensive DevOps plan provides a structured approach to implementing the full roadmap for TerraFusion Professional, with a focus on scalability, security, and performance. The phased implementation ensures that the core infrastructure is in place before moving to more advanced features and optimizations.
